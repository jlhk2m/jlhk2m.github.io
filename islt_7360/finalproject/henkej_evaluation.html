<h1> <u>Evaluation of Mrs. Henke's Classroom</u> </h1> 

<!-- Sections One Who are the Evaluators-->

<h2> Participants </h2>

<p>Joseph is a fellow Web Design student who evaluated my page as a Teacher.
    Joseph, my 33 year old husband, is a fellow graduate student and special education teacher.  
    I have found his observations to be clear and insightful. He is always helpful on the class discussion 
    forums and when looking over my work at home. His own web site is very organized and designed.  
    I believed he would be an excellent evaluator for the developer side of my site. I asked Joseph to look 
    at the code specifically and provide feedback. He used my HP Laptop 15-bs0xx with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200C 
    CPU @ 2.5 GHz, 2701 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processors which uses Windows 10 Home edition and has 8GB of RAM. 
    We use a home wireless wireless internet connection and Google Chrome.</p>

<p> My observed user was Annette, she is the parent of one of my students. Her student is new to our district and 
    she has an open line of communication with me.  Annette is one of my user testers and is in her late thirties. 
    Annette and I have built a relationship and are always looking for ways to communicate about the activities in 
    class and help that parents can provide at home. She was able to provide user specific feedback on the use of the website pages. 
    She is currently an a house wife and forward to seeing the final result. I asked her to review the design and content of the site. 
    She used a DELL Laptop with Intel Core i5 processor with 1GB RAM and used Internet Explorer and connected through our school's 
    wireless internet.</p>

<p> My other user tester was Molly, is a former students parent. She is also a former teacher that is very knowledgeable about classroom 
    course work and resources in the classroom. Her comments and perspective were very welcome! Molly reviewed my site, in terms of 
    design and content, on a HP Elite Book i5 processor which uses Windows 10 Home (64-bit) and has 4GB of RAM. She was at home on a 
    wireless internet connection and Google Chrome. </p>

<p> All agreed the navigation was easy to use and the color scheme was easy on their eyes. Also, all rated the design with top marks. 
    The simplicity of the page was commented on by all users. Interestingly, the Observer did not like the colors for the navigation font-size
    or style and found it hard to read while the other users thought the text choice was excellent and lent to easy reading.
    Joseph found a few problems in my code. I had a few typos within the content and a couple tags that he questioned were relevant. </p>
<p> I observed Annette struggle to find some of the information I asked her to find (contact information (due the page being under construction), purpose 
    of the classroom page, and one of the classroom activities). She commented that the link names in the navigation weren’t as clear after they had been used.  
    A darker color and list activities horizontally might be easier on the eyes than listing vertically. </p>
<p>Molly, one of the Users, enjoyed the background! There was some feedback concerning whether the banner on each page should be 
    a sunrise or something more related to education.Most agreed on the color choices and thought they were pleasing and well-coordinated. 
    Annette did think the link colors were too clashing.</p>
<p> Overall, the general consensus was that it was a good design. There were four different browsers used; Google Chrome and Internet Explorer, 
    in testing and all worked fine. There were no comments on page loading difficulties or anything being out of place. 
    An HP and Dell, with varioud types of access, i.e., DSL, Wireless, and commerical internet, all of which 
    worked well. The Users in the testing thought the value of the site was a good start wanted to learn more because of what they 
    saw on the site. Overall, the perception was that the site was clean, simple at this point.</p>

<!--Recommendations from Users-->

        
<h2> Recommended/Planned Changes</h2>
<p> Based on the feedback that I have collected, I propose making changes in the following areas:</p>

<h3>Improving Design and Navigation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Titling:</b> Be consistent in all the titling in your navigation, if one page is bold make sure that is how all of them should be.</li>
    <li><b>Banner:</b> Make a new banner that goes with the purpose of your page, the sunrise is pretty but doesn't go well with your page.</li>
    <li><b>Links:</b> Change the color of the links so that they are easy to see even after they have been visited.</li> 
</ul> 

<h3>Enriching content</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Home Page:</b> I would like to add a picture of me and my family to the "Teacher Introduction" in order to help the parents to put a name to a face. 
    There are some parents that I will never meet but I would like to give them a face to go with my voice (phone conversations) and introduction.</li>
    <li><b>Hyperlinks</b> Annette and Molly both suggested a darker color for the font in each link on the webpage.</li>
    <li><b>Unfinished Pages</b> All had suggested for content they would like to see on the pages that are currently under construction.  
    Each would like to see local Agencies that are available to families with children with disabilities that can guide them to respite services, 
    summer camps, in home therapies, sensory items, or support groups.  Each would like to have the Newsletter for each month linked under
    the calendar table, and for contact me they would like a phone number and an email for contacting the teacher and school.</li>
    <li><b>Multimedia:</b> There was a suggestion for the banner to remove the sunrise and have something with a lighter background and
    more of a educational purpose.</li>
    </ul>

<h3> Enhancing Credibility </h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Citations:</b> Users were not sure if content was original, so I will be adding another disclaimer to the website to make sure it is clear.</li>
</ul>

<!--Code Revisions-->

<h3> Revising Code</h3>

<p>Behind the scenes the developer tester offered suggestions in changes to the code to make a validation without errors. While this may 
    not affect the site audience, it will make the site more usable. In order to make my pages validate, I had to make all of the coding
     corrections that Joseph recommended as well, he was able to find a couple that were overlooked by myself and the validation webiste.</p>

<!--My Reflections on the Evaluations-->

<h2> Reflections on Evaluation Process</h2>
        
<p> This is the second time I have used the Mizzou Evaluation Form for websites. Each time I have been grateful for the addition feedback.
    For instance, observing Annette going through my site helped me grasp how my target users might understand the basic organization and 
    navigation of the site. It is important for me to witness that others may a different thought process on how to use something than I 
    had in mind.  Each user was able to give me direct feedback on how to improve and enhance my site. Also, the different evaluators 
    each had viewpoints that helped me understand how a teacher, a mother, or a casual observer would react to my site. 
    These users had some very specific changes that would help enhance the site for the specific purpose of a classroom,
     while the teacher was more interested in how easy the pages were to read and navigate through.</p>
<p>All in all I received positive feedback that will make the site more user friendly and purposeful. As suggested by my evaluators, 
    I will change my banner, make my hyperlinks more visable, and finish construction to my resource and contact pages in order to make my 
    site better my the parents that will be visiting my site. It might be helpful if I add more links to pertinent sites to offer 
    more information. I am anxious to implement the changes to the site and am hoping to have a usable, creative, purposeful 
    site when I’m done!</p>
