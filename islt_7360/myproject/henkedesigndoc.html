<h1> <u>Mrs. Henke's Design Document</u> </h1> 

<h2> Purpose: </h2>

<p> 
<p class="main"> This web site will be designed for the use of the parents of the students in my specific classroom.  I have a very specific type of classroom.  In my classroom, I have no more than 6 students, where I teach all the subject areas as well as collect IEP data for each student's individual goals.  This will be a very informal website where the parents of each of my students will be able to view and gather information on our daily activities as needed.  There are two main purposes for my webpage.  First, is to have a media presence for my classroom that will allow each family to have access to my specific classroom's activities and information to my specific students' families. 
    Second, this webpage will provide the families with a collection point to access classroom objectives, classroom materials, newsletters, and contact information.  The families for each my specific students will be able to use the website to follow their students learning experience and find additional information as necessary.  </p>

<h2>Audience:</h2>

<p> 
<p class="main"> The target audience for this web site will be parents and/or legal guardians of my specific classroom students.  This group of adults share a love and desire for being involved in their child's learning, and is made up of men and women of different ages.  Over the years, they have had various experiences with their child's classroom teacher. 
    Their discussions center on the objectives and progress of their child while they are at school.  They love seeing how well their student is participating in the activities and how their student is making progress toward their goals.  

<h2> Needs Assessment: </h2>

<p> 
<p class="main"> Four parents of students provided me with a list of items that they felt would be most helful on a webpage.  The parents want to see links:   </P>

   <blockquote> <ul class="a">
            <li> Welcome to the Classroom! </li> 
            <li> Newsletters and Classroom Objectives </li>
            <li> Resources and Additional Materials </li>
            <li> Classroom Calendar </li>
            <li> Photo Gallery</li>
            <li> Contact Me </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>   
<h3><i> Questions asked to the group:</i></h3>
<p><i> What type of information would you find most helfup on our website?</i></p>

<blockquote><ul class="a">
        <li> About the teacher and classroom; who is teaching our child and how do we get ahold of them? </li> 
        <li> Information for local resources; disabilities, activities, camps, general local resources. </li>
        <li> Links for downloading classroom materials in case papers get lost between school and home. </li>
        <li> I want to be able to view pictures of the classroom activities and I want to know what my child is supposed to be learning while they are at school. </li>
        </ul>  
    </blockquote>
<p><i> What type of information do you NOT want to see included on the website?</i></p>

<blockquote> <ul class="a">
        <li> Public information about my child; name, personal information, their specific disability etc... </li> 
        <li> Parents want things to be minimized; nothing that can already get from the district or school's general website.  </li>
        </ul>  
</blockquote>

<p><i> What would you MOST like to see on our website?</i></p>

<blockquote> <ul class="a">
        <li> Frequent updates for deadlines specific to the classroom </li> 
        <li> Photos of the classroom activities on a regular basis </li>
         </ul>  
</blockquote>

<h3><i> Five Reference Websites:</i></h3>
   <p> These site are examples of good and/or bad artifacts that I am considering while creating my final design:</p>
  
   <blockquote> <ol type="1">
            <li> For navigation, this website provides the navagation style that is similar to my idea for Mrs. Henke's Classroom webpage here: <a href="http://bes3rd.weebly.com/"> an example of good navigation.</a>  </li> 
            <li> For layout I would a simple layout that includes both pictures and text content that is easy for user to use and view.  This would be <a href="https://www.amazingclassroom.com/templates/animal_fun/default.asp?cag=GAMECOX97"> an a layout to avoid.</a>  </li>
            <li> A layout with a simple background, picture, and navigation are ideal. <a href="http://mrshudsonwillettmusic.weebly.com/"> Here is a good layout example.</a> </li>
            <li> For content style, my classroom site will not be similar as the example as it is too difficult to read; <a href="https://misslappe.weebly.com/">avoid some text styles.</a>  </li>
            <li> For a preferred color scheme, the color on this webpage is calming and representative of what I believe a parent would want to see when looking at a classroom webpage.  <a href="http://www.ourclassweb.com/"> Preferred Colors</a></li>
            </ol>  
    </blockquote>
<h2> Content: </h2>

<p>
<p class="main"> Based on the responses of the parents, I have chosen to include the following contect areas: </p>

<blockquote> <ul class="a">
    <li> <u>Welcome!</u> A page just for the introduction to the classroom and me as a teacher. </li>
    <li> <u>Classroom Actitivies:</u> This section will include the objectives for each subject area and will be updated frequently. This section will have pictures of students completing objectives and subject specific materials for additional reinforcement of the concepts at home.  </li> 
    <li> <u>Calendar:</u> This will show important dates specific to my classroom activities and events. </li>
    <li> <u>Resources:</u> In this section I will include links for local resources. </li>
    <li> <u>Contact Me:</u> I will provide a section with an email area to go directly to me for an questions or comments the parents might have. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2> Presentation of Information/Rationale of Organization:</h2>
 <p>
     <p class="main"> The webpage will be hierarchical in nature because I have a central subject with supporting pages.</p>
     <blockquote> <ul class="a">
         <li> To provide a <b> consistency </b> for the webpage and my audience, all the pages will contain/use:</li>
         <ul>
             <li> The same banner at the top of each page </li>
             <li> A simple heading at the top of each content section providing the Page Name. </li>
             <li> Same color scheme for each contect sections. </li>
             <li> Contact information in the footer of each contect section page. </li>
             <li> A link to go back to the "Home Page" as well as a consistent navigation bar on each page </li>
         </ul>
        </blockquote>
         <li> <b>Welcome!</b> </li>
         <ul> 
             <li>  Will be laid out in a 3 box format. </li>
             <li>  Will provide navigation to each content setion. </li>
             <li>  Will contain an introduction to the classroom, introduction to the teacher, building mission statement, and contact information. </li>
             <li>  Will display at least one picture. </li>
         </ul>    
         <li> All other <b> content sections</b> will provide horizontal navigation across both the top and bottom of the page. </li>
         <ul>
             <li> I plan to keep the pages under three screen lengths.</li>
             <li> As the school year goes on I know that content under each section will be added to and will have enough content to justify having navigation on both top and bottom of the page. </li>
         </ul>
        </ul>
     </blockquote>
     <p> The following details in the other 4 content sections is proposed:</p>
     <ol type="1">
         <li><b><u> Classroom Activities</b></u></li>
         <ul>
             <li> Initially Classroom Activities will be divided using a horizon line for 4 subject area objectives; Language Arts, Math, Social Studies, and Science. </li>
             <li> Each of the 4 subject areas will contain the objective and the weekly activities. </li>
             <li> Links for additional materials or websites to use at home to reinforce the concepts being taught in the classroom. </li>
         </ul>
         <li> <b><u> Calendar </b></u></li>
         <ul>
             <li> Calendar will include any dates for events or classroom reminders; homework, forms, or supplies. </li>
         </ul>
         <li> <b><u> Resources </b></u></li>
         <ul>
             <li> Links for local agencies that provide therapy, camps, and support. </li>
             <li> Links for information on disabilities. </li>
         </ul>
         <li> <b><u> Contact Me </b></u></li>
         <ul>
             <li> Embedded/built in email that goes directly to me, so that parents do not have to copy and paste my email or have their own email in order to contact me. </li>
         </ul>   
         </ul>
         <h2> Media:</h2> 
         <p> 
        <p class="main">The banner will a be graphic that I create using Adobe Photoshop.  All other images used will be photos taken by myself and the staff in my classroom to represent the activities and objectives on my classroom. 
         These will include feature photos on the "Welcome Page", photos of various classroom projects produced by the students in the "Classroom Activities" section, and pictures for various resources in the "Resources"section, and a picture of the teacher in the "Contact Me" section.  
         I intend to include a footer statement, "All images used in this site are original.  Any further use of these images is prohibited without permission from the website owner, Jessica Henke." </p>

         <h2> Color Scheme and Rationale:</h2>
         <p>
             <p class="main"> Since this page is for parents and a classroom, I plan to use soft and calming colors, such as; blue and purple.  Blue is associated with depth and stability.  It symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, and intelligence. Purple combines the calm stability of blue
                 and fierce energy of red.  The color purple is often associated with royalty, power, and ambition.  These are all attritubes that I see in my students.  A light blue will be use as the main background color.  Text will be black and a medium variation of purple for the navigation tabs.
                 I will also use white behind the text on the content pages in order to keep the pages user friendly. I want the webpage to be easy on the eyes, calming, and simple. You can view my <p><a href="islt_7360/myproject/colorscheme.docx">color scheme</a></p> here. </p>
                <p id="rcorners3"><b>blue</b></p>
                <p id="rcorners4"><b>purple</b></p>
                <p id="rcorners5"><b>white</b></p>
